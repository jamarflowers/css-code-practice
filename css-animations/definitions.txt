  
  
    The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.
    
    The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.
    During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.
    Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", 
    which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 
    100% is when the animation is complete.

  Tip: For best browser support, you should always define both the 0% and the 100% selectors.
    
    
    CSS3 transitions allows you to change property values smoothly 
    (from one value to another),over a given duration.
    
    To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:
     - the CSS property you want to add an effect to
     - the duration of the effect
     
    ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
