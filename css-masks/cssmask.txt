A Mask in CSS is a Image and Clips are paths

Clips are always vector paths

-------------------------------------

.element {
  clip: rect(10px, 20px, 30px, 40px);
}

The clip property is deprecated in CSS
-------------------------------------
clip** shipped in browsers, it will probably always work. And the browser support for it is extremely strong: 
pretty much every browser ever. Plus I've heard animation performance from it trumps newer methods.
